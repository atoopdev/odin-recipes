    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is not fall without a delicious pumpkin bread recipe. This recipe has the best pumpkin flavor in my opinion. I have made this recipe twice in the past month or so. In my experience this loaf lasts very well in the refrigerator - if you don't eat it all at once that is.</p>
    <p>I recommend slightly reducing the final sugar/cinnamon topping as I found a lot of it falls off right away after baking - but its up to you!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15oz can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup neutral cooking oil or melted butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 2/3c sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp (heaped) nutmeg </li>
        <li>1/4 tsp (heaped) ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 pinches ground cloves</li>
        <li>2 1/4c all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Oil or butter a 6 cup loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Combine pumpkin, oil, eggs, and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add remaining dry ingredients together in a separate bowl, gently mix. Slowly sprinkle dry ingredients into wet, mixing and pouring in turn, until everything is mixed.</li>
        <li>Scrape batter into loaf pan. Mix 1 Tbsp cinnamon and 1 Tbsp sugar together in a small bowl. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar mix on top of batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 65 to 75 minutes. Cook until knife poked into the middle comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for 10min before removing from pan - but loaf cake is just fine cooling in the pan.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
